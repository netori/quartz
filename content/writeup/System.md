> **System** is a series of [OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "wikipedia:Operating system")/[VM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "wikipedia:Virtual machine") hybrids that was designed by [Alice Soft](https://alicesoft.fandom.com/wiki/Alice_Soft "Alice Soft") to cope with porting their games across different computer platforms. This was especially important in the early days of Alice Soft's history, when there were multiple prevalent families of computers ([PC-98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-9801 "wikipedia:NEC PC-9801"), [x68k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x68k "wikipedia:x68k"), [FM-Towns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-Towns "wikipedia:FM-Towns") etc) competing on the Japanese PC market. A similar strategy was used by other developers at the time, such as [Infocom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom "wikipedia:Infocom")'s famous Z-Machine interpreter.

System is a process virtual machine desgined by AliceSoft to increase accessbility between different computer platforms.
