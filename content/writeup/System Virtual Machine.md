> **System** is a series of OS/VM hybrids that was designed by [Alice Soft](https://www.alicesoft.com/) to cope with porting their games across different computer platforms. This was especially important in the early days of Alice Soft's history, when there were multiple prevalent families of computers ([PC-98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-9801 "wikipedia:NEC PC-9801"), [x68k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x68k "wikipedia:x68k"), [FM-Towns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-Towns "wikipedia:FM-Towns") etc) competing on the Japanese PC market. A similar strategy was used by other developers at the time, such as [Infocom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom "wikipedia:Infocom")'s famous Z-Machine interpreter.
