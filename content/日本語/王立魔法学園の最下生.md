## Ch 1
よくもまあ　我々の商品を　盗ってくれたな！
How dare you try to steal our merchandise!

今日という今日は　観念しろ！
Today is the day you prepare yourself.

どけ！私にもやらせろ！
(DL) Get out of the way! Let me do it! 

初めて「盗み」に失敗したその日
On the day where I tried to steal for the first time but failed.

たしかに俺は　自らの「死」を　覚悟していた
I was certainly prepared for my own death.
TL: Death should be quoted. This brings into question that his death meant something different. Moreover, how should the phrase "たしかに俺は" be interpreted. Does it mean that he is "certainly" sure of his death, or is sure of "certain" death?   

我々に　何か文句が　ある　というのか！
