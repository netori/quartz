After crafting an exploit for [[writeup/Rance IX|Rance IX]], I then looked at this game due to its AntiCheat features. Specfically, the AntiCheat stores an encrypted copy of data to a buffer, performs a comparison between the copy and new data, and triggers a death flag if there's an inequality, otherwise, the encrypted copy is replaced with the new data. This death flag causes the character to die on the next turn.\n\nI utilized [[writeup/System Virtual Machine#Tools|tools]] designed for the System architecture combined with my previous knowledge to craft a simple exploit for *BEAR*. Largely reminiscent of ACTk for Unity.\n\n# Decompile *ain* file\n``` c#\nint C_INT::Get()\n{\n\tSH_LOCALDELETE(0);\n\tC_VALUE_ENCRYPTION cValueEncryption = SH_LOCALCREATE(0, 194);\n\tint nXorKey = this.GetKey();\n\tint nValue = cValueEncryption.Decryption(this.m_nCode, nXorKey, this.GetCodePattern());\n\tint nBackUp = cValueEncryption.Decryption(this.m_nBackUpCode, nXorKey, this.GetBackUpCodePattern());\n\tif (!system.IsDebugMode())\n\t{\n\t\tif (nValue != nBackUp)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t■チート疑惑設定(true); //Cheat Suspected\n\t\t\tnValue = 0;\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (this.m_nValue != nValue)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t■チート疑惑設定(true); //Cheat Suspected\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn nValue;\n\t}\n\tif (this.m_nValue != nValue)\n\t{\n\t\tthis.Set(this.m_nValue);\n\t}\n\treturn this.m_nValue;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2023-03-10T13:02:08.383554211Z","tags":null},"/writeup/Rance-IX":{"title":"Rance IX","content":"# Abstract\nRance IX is a game made by AliceSoft, and its instructions are interprepted using Alicesoft's proprietary virtual machine (VM): [[writeup/System Virtual Machine|System]]. \n\nI crafted an exploit for Rance IX by determining where and how the System interpreter fetches instructions, how these instructions are decoded, and finally writing my own scripts to rewrite how these instructions are executed.\n\n# Context\nSystem is a virtual machine that interprets Alicesoft's proprietary game files (*.ain*, *.jaf*, *.jam*, etc.).\n\n![System-Interprepter](images/system42-interprepter.png)*A graph disassembly produced by IDA of the System VM.*\n\nThe above graph is a portion of the System interpreter; it's a gargantuan switch-case statement (with over 100 cases), and each case pertains to a particular bytecode that the System interpreter will execute. The execution units that are assigned to a specific bytecode are commonly referred to as handlers.  \n\nA common practice in reverse-engineering virtualized malware, or virtual machines is to follow a process called _lifting, translating, and repackaging_; whereby, the reverse engineer determines exactly what each handler does (_lifting_), somehow convert the information into a language that the CPU and disassemblers understand (_translating_), and finally repackaging the binary (_repackaging_). It's tedious and complicated, but there already are existing tools for the System VM.\n\n...\n\n# Crafting the Exploit\n\n\n# Credits\n-   **nunuhara, kichikuou, OPNA2608, and toufuguy** - Thank you all for your work regarding Alicesoft's proprietary engine and file formats. I would not have been able to make any key analyses without the use of your tools. Thank you so much for sharing your work since I have definitely learned a lot about virtual machine architecture and the System engine. \n-   **SomeLoliCatGirl** - Thank you for the wonderful AIN to bytecode decompiler. Your decompiler helped me tremendously with my analysis because I was able to locate where the bytecode was being interpreted and where it was being stored. As a result, I was able to craft my own custom bytecode injections, and effectively localize myself within the System VM architecture without doing much guessing.\n-   **Tim Blazytko** - Great educational video regarding analysis on VM architecture! \n-   **FamousAnos** - Thank you for the save!\n-   **Darkbyte and contributors** - Obviously...","lastmodified":"2023-03-10T13:02:08.383554211Z","tags":null},"/writeup/System-Virtual-Machine":{"title":"System Virtual Machine","content":"# Abstract\nSystem is a process virtual machine desgined by AliceSoft to increase accessbility between different computer platforms. \n\n\u003e [!quote] Brief by [AliceSoft Fandom](https://alicesoft.fandom.com/wiki/System)\n\u003e\n\u003e **System** is a series of OS/VM hybrids that was designed by [Alice Soft](https://www.alicesoft.com/) to cope with porting their games across different computer platforms.
