After crafting an exploit for [[writeup/Rance IX|Rance IX]], I then looked at this game due to its AntiCheat features. Specfically, the AntiCheat stores an encrypted copy of data to a buffer, performs a comparison between the copy and new data, and triggers a death flag if there's an inequality, otherwise, the encrypted copy is replaced with the new data. This death flag causes the character to die on the next turn.\n\nI utilized [[writeup/System Virtual Machine#Tools|tools]] designed for the System architecture combined with my previous knowledge to craft a simple exploit for *BEAR*.

Changing those properties in the game triggered the watchpoint and led me to the subroutine that accessed those properties.\n\n![System-Interprepter](ranceix-vm-access.png)\n*A snippet of the subroutine that accessed the character properties.*\n\nTo determine how and where the subroutine belonged, I used IDA's graph analysis to display the control-flow of the function that it belonged to. \n\n![System-Interprepter](images/system42-interprepter.png)\n*The subroutine that accessed those character properties was found somewhere in the middle.*\n\nThe function is actually a gargantuan switch-case statement (with over 200 cases), and the subroutine is part of a case. After reading through some [[writeup/System Virtual Machine#Resources|resources]], this function is actually the dispatcher for the inputted bytecode from an *ain* script. The case that I was in was just a handler for the bytecode.\n\n### Finding `VM Entry`\nIn general, virtualized functions will have their own instruction pointer and stack space. For the virtualized function to interface with these components, it can utilize hardware registers, stack, and heap to communicate changes. Therefore, to prevent any corruption, a virtualized function must preserve the context of the function that called it, and restore it. Preservation is usually found at the function prologue; on the other hand, restoration is usually found at the function epilogue.\nRespectively, they are called `VM Entry` and `VM Exit`.\n\nIn this case, finding `VM Entry` is relatively easy; trace upwards to the beginning of the function.\n\n![Rance-VM-Entry](images/ranceix-vm-entry.png)\n*A snippet of `VM Entry.`*\n\n### Execution Cycle\nAfter finding `VM Entry`, I was curious as to how this function was called.\n\n![[images/ranceix-vm-loop.png]]\n*A loop that calls `VM Entry`*\n\nAfter some debugging, this loop inputs the bytecode from the *ain* script as an argument to `VM Entry`, increments the virtual machine instruction pointer, and calls `VM Entry`. This execution continues indefinitely until there is a signal from `*(CJaffaVM + 0x234)` to exit.\n\nIn C terms, this is how the execution cycle would look like....\n```c\ndo\n{\n  vm_ip = *(CJaffaVM + 0x224);\n  bytecode = *vm_ip;\n  *(CJaffaVM + 0x224) = vm_ip + 1;\n  vm_entry(CJaffaVM, a2, a3, bytecode);\n}\nwhile ( !*(CJaffaVM + 0x234) );\n```\n\n### Bytecode Storage\nAfter some more reverse-engineering, I found out where the bytecode was being stored.\n\n## Exploit Development\nI didn't want to hook the execution cycle needlessly, since the game will lag. So, I created a thread to interface with these components, and if needed, locks the execution cycle to prevent any access shared resource.\n\nThe script can be found [here](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026t=23630\u0026sid=9dd754c98ad76236735299b9f017dbae\u0026start=15), just look a few posts down.\n\n## Credits\n-   **nunuhara, kichikuou, OPNA2608, and toufuguy** - Thank you all for your work regarding Alicesoft's proprietary engine and file formats. I would not have been able to make any key analyses without the use of your tools. Thank you so much for sharing your work since I have definitely learned a lot about virtual machine architecture and the System engine. \n-   **SomeLoliCatGirl** - Thank you for the wonderful AIN to bytecode decompiler. Your decompiler helped me tremendously with my analysis because I was able to locate where the bytecode was being interpreted and where it was being stored. As a result, I was able to craft my own custom bytecode injections, and effectively localize myself within the System VM architecture without doing much guessing.\n-   **Tim Blazytko** - Great educational video regarding analysis on VM architecture! \n-   **FamousAnos** - Thank you for the save!\n-   **Darkbyte and contributors** - Obviously...","lastmodified":"2023-03-11T10:23:34.500390885Z","tags":null},"/writeup/System-Virtual-Machine":{"title":"System Virtual Machine","content":"## Abstract\nSystem is a process virtual machine designed by AliceSoft to increase accessibility between different computer platforms. \n\n\u003e [!quote] Brief by [AliceSoft Fandom](https://alicesoft.fandom.com/wiki/System)\n\u003e\n\u003e **System** is a series of OS/VM hybrids that was designed by [Alice Soft](https://www.alicesoft.com/) to cope with porting their games across different computer platforms. This was especially important in the early days of Alice Soft's history, when there were multiple prevalent families of computers ([PC-98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-9801 \"wikipedia:NEC PC-9801\"), [x68k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x68k \"wikipedia:x68k\"), [FM-Towns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-Towns \"wikipedia:FM-Towns\") etc) competing on the Japanese PC market. A similar strategy was used by other developers at the time, such as [Infocom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom \"wikipedia:Infocom\")'s famous Z-Machine interpreter.\n\n## Environment\nSystem is a virtual machine that interprets Alicesoft's proprietary game files (*.ain*, *.jaf*, *.jam*, etc.).\n\n![System-Interprepter](images/system42-interprepter.png)*A graph disassembly produced by IDA of a portion of the System VM.*\n\nThe above graph is a portion of the System interpreter; it's a gargantuan switch-case statement (with over 100 cases), and each case pertains to a particular bytecode that the System interpreter will execute. The execution units that are assigned to a specific bytecode are commonly referred to as handlers.  \n\nA common practice in reverse-engineering virtualized malware, or virtual machines is to follow a process called _lifting, translating, and repackaging_; whereby, the reverse engineer determines exactly what each handler does (_lifting_), somehow convert the information into a language that the CPU and disassemblers understand (_translating_), and finally repackaging the binary (_repackaging_). It's tedious and complicated, but there already are existing tools for the System VM.\n\n## System4 Analysis\nSystem4 is modeled after heap virtual machine architecture. It has an entry and an exit, calculations that are applied to datum located inside its memory heap, and a dispatcher to individual handlers for some inputted bytecode. These core concepts can be explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6udPT79itk).\n\n### `CJaffaVM`\n`CJaffaVM` (denoted by RTTI) is an object that governs the System virtual machine. There is only **one** instance of this object; moreover, there is always a static address that points to this instance.\n\n### `CPage`\n`CPage` (denoted by RTTI) is an object that contains game variables and in-game values. There are at least a hundred of these instances.\n\n### `CPage` Array\nThe `CPage` Array contains all `CPage` instances.\n\n## Resources\nThe following hyperlinks lead to some insightful references to the System VM.\n\n### Tools\n- [alice-tools](https://github.com/nunuhara/alice-tools) - Incredibly useful tool for extracting/editing files from AliceSoft games.\n- [ain decompiler](https://github.com/UserUnknownFactor/AinDecompiler) -  Fantastic tool developed by **SomeLoliCatGirl** that decompiles *ain* file formats into native System bytecode.\n\n### General\n- [haniwa.technology](https://haniwa.technology/) - This site collects technical information and resources relating to games and game engines developed by AliceSoft.\n- [xsystem4](https://github.com/nunuhara/xsystem4) - System4 for UNIX-like operating systems\n\n### Uses System\n- [[Beat Angel Escalayer R]]\n- The Rance Series\n\t- [[writeup/Rance IX |Rance IX]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-11T10:23:34.500390885Z","tags":null}}
